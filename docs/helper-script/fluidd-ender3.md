- Once is installed, to access to the original Fluidd Web Interface, just use your printer's IP address with port 4408 in your Web browser such as: `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:4408/` (replacing xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx by your local IP address).

    !!! Note
        You can update Fluidd with Update Manager when a new version is available.

- When configuring printer forwarding through a reverse proxy, remember to include your domain in the `moonraker.conf` file.

    ```ini
    [authorization]
    force_logins: False
    cors_domains:
        *.lan
        *.local
        *://localhost
        *://localhost:*
        *://my.mainsail.xyz
        *://app.fluidd.xyz
        *://<YOUR DOMAIN>
    ```
